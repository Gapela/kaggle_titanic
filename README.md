## step by step
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and unzip it into the `data` folder.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Analyze the data using `jupyter notebook`.
    - Use `pandas` to load the data and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    - Use datafame.info() to get the data types and null values.
    - Use dataframe.describe() to get the summary statistics.
    - Use dataframe.isnull().sum() to get the null values.
